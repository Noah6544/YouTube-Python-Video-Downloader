# YouTube-Python-Video-Downloader
I cloned this from another repository and made it into a program that can be easily used, hopefully.
If you want to use this follow these steps.
1. Enter the directory that you want to have your files downloaded into (I'll eventually make an option so that you can choose to deafault to the folder that the program is in, maybe not)
2. Enter the link of the video (I'm not sure if this works with other videos outside of videos. MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT ADD A SPACE AFTER OR BEFORE THE LINK. if you are in pycharm, after you paste the link, don't press enter, instead, click on the prompting text "ENTER THE LINK...." this makes it so that when you don't press enter it won't open in your browser. This might not be always
3. enjoy and let other people know

I made this because I don't like having to stress over the worrying about viruses and whatnot with online downloaders. 
the downside is that i don't think it gets videos over 1080p. sorry. i'll try to fix this later, but i'm entering high school now so i'm quite busy. no promises. let me know if this helps you!
